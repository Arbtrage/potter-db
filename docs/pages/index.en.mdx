# Introduction

Welcome to the Documentation of [Potter DB](https://potterdb.com)!

Potter DB is an API with data from the Harry Potter Universe.

# Getting started

Before start using the API you should decide whether you want to use our GraphQL or REST API.

### GraphQL

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  The GraphQL API is still work in progress and some features like filtering and
  sorting is currently **not** implemented!
</Callout>

The advantage of GraphQL is that you can precisly specify which data you need and therefore prevent over- or underfetching of data.

To use the GraphQL API you have to make `POST` request to the GraphQL `/graphql` endpoint.

### REST

To use the REST API you have to make a `GET` request to one of the endpoints of the REST API.

Visit https://api.potterdb.com to get an overview of all the available endpoints.

## Rate limiting

To prevent malicious usage of the Potter DB API there's an ip-based limit of 900 requests per hour (15 request / minute). If you hit this limit, you will receive a `429 To Many Requests`.

## Authentication

The Potter DB API is free to use and therefore no authentication is required.

## Stats
