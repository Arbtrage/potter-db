# GraphQL API
Our GraphQL API provides a flexible and powerful way to interact with the Potter DB. This section will introduce you to the key aspects of our GraphQL API and how to leverage its capabilities.

## Base URL
The base URL for our GraphQL API is as follows:
- https://graphql.potterdb.com/v1

## GraphQL Endpoint
To make GraphQL queries and mutations, send `POST` requests to the GraphQL endpoint (`/graphql`) with your queries and variables in the request body. The API expects the request body to be in JSON format.

{/*
## GraphQL Playground
We provide a [GraphQL Playground](https://api.potterdb.com/graphiql) where you can interactively explore the API and test your GraphQL queries. It offers tools like auto-completion and syntax highlighting to help you write your queries.
*/}

## Querying Data
GraphQL allows you to request precisely the data you need. To construct a query, specify the fields you want to retrieve and their relationships. For example:

```graphql
query {
  books {
    nodes {
      title
      releaseDate
  		chapters {
      	nodes {
          title
          slug
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
In this query, we are requesting the `title` and `releaseDate` of all `books` and the `title` and `slug` of all `chapters` of each `book`.

## Schema
To get an overview of the schema of the GraphQL API have a look at our [GraphQL Schema](https://github.com/danielschuster-muc/potter-db/blob/master/backend/schema.graphql).
