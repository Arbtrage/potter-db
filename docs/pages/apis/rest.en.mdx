## Filtering, Sorting and Pagination

You can also filter and paginate the results of collections via query params.

### Filtering

We use Ransack to filter the results. Checkout their [list of search matchers](https://activerecord-hackery.github.io/ransack/getting-started/search-matches/).

> Example: Filter the characters by the name `Harry`

`/v1/characters?filter[name_cont_any]=Harry`

### Sorting

You can also sort the results by a specific field. Add a minus before the field to sort descending.

> Example: Sort all characters by name

`/v1/characters?sort=name`

### Pagination

Use `page[number=1]` and `page[size]=5` to paginate the results of the API.

> Example: Displaying the results of page 10 with 20 results per page

`/v1/characters?page[number=10]&page[size=20]`
