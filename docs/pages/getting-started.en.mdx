# Getting started

## Choose your API

Before start using the API you should decide whether you want to use our GraphQL API or REST API.

{/* TODO: advantages of each api */}

### GraphQL

```
https://api.potterdb.com/graphql
```

### REST

```
https://api.potterdb.com
```

## Rate limiting

To prevent malicious usage of the Potter DB API there's an ip-based limit of 1000 requests per hour (16.7 rpm). If you hit this limit, you will receive a `429 To Many Request`, but there should be no reason for hitting it with proper caching strategies.

## Authentication

The Potter DB API is free to use and therefore no authentication is required.
