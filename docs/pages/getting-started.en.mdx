# REST vs. GraphQL
The Potter DB: API offers two main ways to access our magical data: **REST** and **GraphQL**. Choose the one that best suits your needs and development style.
- **REST**: If you prefer a straightforward, resource-based approach, REST endpoints are the way to go. You'll make HTTP requests to specific URLs to retrieve data.
- **GraphQL**: For more flexible and precise data queries, GraphQL allows you to request exactly what you need and nothing more. Construct your queries to fetch data with fine-grained control.

## Authentication
The Potter DB: API is free to use and therefore no authentication is required.

## Base URL
The base URL for accessing the Potter DB: API is:
- **REST API**: `https://api.potterdb.com/v1`
- **GraphQL API**: `https://api.potterdb.com/graphql`

Make sure to prepend this base URL to the specific endpoint you wish to access.

## Current version
The current version of the Potter DB: API is **v1**.

## Rate limiting
To maintain the quality and prevent malicious usage of the Potter DB: API there is an ip-based limit of 900 requests per hour (15 request / minute). If you hit this limit, you will receive a `429 To Many Requests`.
Please note that these rate limits are subject to change, so it's essential to check the latest rate limit information in the documentation or via API responses.

Now that you have the basics, let's dive into the API documentation to explore available endpoints and start crafting your magical queries and requests.
Refer to the documentation sections for [REST](/apis/rest) and [GraphQL](apis/graphql) for detailed information on how to use the API effectively.
