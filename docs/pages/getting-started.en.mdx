# Getting started

## Choosing an API

Before start using the API you should decide whether you want to use our GraphQL or REST API.

{/* TODO: advantages of each api */}

### GraphQL

To use the GraphQL API you have to make a to the GraphQL `/graphql` endpoint.

#### Example Request

```shell
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query": "query{ characters(first: 5) { edges{ node{ name }}}}"}' https://api.potterdb.com/graphql
```

#### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "characters": {
      "edges": [
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "'Handsome Poltergeist'"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "'Mrs Next Door'"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "1992 Gryffindor vs Slytherin Quidditch match spectators"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "1996 Gryffindor Quidditch Keeper trials spectators"
          }
        },
        {
          "node": {
            "name": "19th-century Flying Instructor"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### REST

```
https://api.potterdb.com
```

## Rate limiting

To prevent malicious usage of the Potter DB API there's an ip-based limit of 9000 requests per hour (15 request / minute). If you hit this limit, you will receive a `429 To Many Request`, but there should be no reason for hitting it with proper caching strategies.

## Authentication

The Potter DB API is free to use and therefore no authentication is required.
